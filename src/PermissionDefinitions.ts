/**
 __NOTE: This class `PermissionDefinition_DOCS` is a dummy one, it is only the placeholder for docs for the real [PermissionDefinition](/miscellaneous/typealiases.html#PermissionDefinition) which is a type alias__.

 A `PermissionDefinition` (in short **PD**) is the fundamental way to define **permission rules**:

 > It grants which **Actions** (eg `approve`, `follow`) a **Role** (eg `EMPLOYEE`) can perform on a **Resource** (eg `Document`), whether on **any** Resource or only on **own** ones.

 The grants can also restrict some *Role-Action-Resource* declarations to:

 - touch only specific **attributes**, defined as an array of attributes names (eg `['title', 'price']`) & optionally glob notation (eg `'*'` or `'!confidentialNotes'`).

 - perform an action only on **OWN Resources**, where Ownership is defined as  **ownership** hooks (i.e async callbacks) that define how the give roles own an particular resource.

 __Note__ : when you use **any ownership hook**, the following rules apply:

 - you 'll need to implement `isOwner` for sure.

 - also need to implement one of `listOwned` OR `limitOwned`, but not both.

  i.e its an all or nothing, also enforced as runtime check - see the reasoning in the [FAQ](/additional-documentation/faq,-gotchas-&-caveats.html).

 __Note__: A PermissionDefinition is a loose definition, meaning that all of the props are **optional**. This is because users can use [defaults](/classes/PermissionDefinitionDefaults.html), use [shortcut syntax for grant actions](/classes/PermissionDefinition_DOCS.html#grant) etc.

 At runtime though, your complete PDs are validated thoroughly at the earliest possible - see [Principles](/additional-documentation/philosophy,-principles-&-architecture.html).

 ## Example

 ```typescript
 {
      roles: ['EMPLOYEE', 'REGISTERED_USER'],
      resource: 'document',
      descr: "I can CRUD only OWN Documents (i.e created by me)." +
             "I can read all but 'confidential' fields.",
      isOwner: async ({ user, resourceId }) => await isUserOwnerOfDocument({ user, resourceId }),
      listOwned: async user => await listOfUserOwnedDocumentIds(user),
      grant: {
        'create:own': ['*'],
        'read:own': ['*', '!confidential'],
        'update:own': ['*', '!confidential'],
        'delete:own': ['*'],
    },
  }
 ```

   Also it can contain the Possession (after a colon), i.e whether they can perform each action only on their *own resources* or on *any resources*, for example `create:own` or `delete:any`. If an action is missing the Possession "any" or "own" then it inherits it from `possession` field of this PD which acts as the PDs default (the local one in the action overrides this the PD default). If there is no default set, it is interpreted as 'any' (reason is that 'own' requires ownership hooks).

   The format is compatible with [Access-Control action rules](https://github.com/onury/accesscontrol#actions-and-action-attributes) but can also be a shortcut syntax of a `string[]` of actions (eg `['approve', 'like', 'dislike']` in which case `possession` and `attributes` are inherited from corresponding fields in the PD (or the defaults).

   Note that by listing an action as a grant on PD, it becomes a legitimate action on your subsequent locked `build()`-ed SAPermission instance. So be careful with naming!

   You can also use the '*' for an action (eg {..., grant: {'*:own'}, ...} which will grant the Role(s) of this PD to any **known action** of this SAPermission instance.
